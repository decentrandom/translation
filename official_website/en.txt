PROBLEMS

Computers can't generate random numbers

As surprising as it may sound, computers can't generate random numbers. A computer is simply a tool to calculate a result based on a given process, not something that makes subconscious or chance-based decisions.

Random numbers generated by computers are typically derived by dividing the time the process is run in microsecond fractions or based on a sequence of a random number table. Although the number may appear 'random', they aren't.

Services based on random numbers lack transparency and fairness

A 'lucky draw' is one common event where randomness is used. Even events that use 'physical randomness' such as picking a ticket out of a box has caused noise regarding falsifying or changing the winner of the draw.

DongA News(August 19, 2018) - 'Controversy Over YouTuber's Event Promising a $3,000 Computer Draws Criticism'
KBS News(July 21, 2015) - 'CEO of Event Managing Company Prosecuted over Rigging Lucky Draw Events' 
YonHap News(Septermber 4, 2014) - 'Police Searches XXXX Company Office over Falsifying Prize Event'
Ordering something based on a random number or choosing a portion of a whole from a random number requires fairness and transparency. Until now, middlemen were given the authority to oversee transparency and randomness.

However, maintaining fairness and transparency in a place where a middleman has the authority is not as easy as it sounds.

DECENTRANDOM

Decentralized
DECENTRANDOM is a completely decentralized model where no middlemen exist. Therefore, random number generation will always guarantee fairness.

High Reliability
Using the Cosmos-SDK and Tendermint Core, DECENTRANDOM provides highly reliable service. Because every block is final upon creation, results can't be reversed after the random number has been generated.

Easy-to-use
Organizers of a lucky-draw event don't have to be knowledgable about DECENTRANDOM to use it. The process of the event remains nearly identical.

Low-cost, Highly-efficient
DECENTRANDOM provides a highly secure & highly efficient random number generation for a small network fee.

Scalable
DECENTRANDOM can be scaled for many use-cases such as: lucky draw, group-making, ingame item generation probability, dice, card games and more.

Simple
DECENTRANDOM is not a complicated system. Everyone can understand its role and participate.

HOW IT WORKS

Create near-coincidental random number based on its participants

Everyone that stakes RAND tokens can take part in creating random numbers. Creators of random numbers receive rewards based on amount staked. As the number of random number generation rounds increase, the probability of manipulation nears zero.

Transparency and Fairness, Simplified

Process of selecting the random number and participants' personal data are encrypted then recorded on the blockchain. Because the moderators/administrators set up the process, user are not burdened with the need of directly interacting with the network. Participants don't have to be familiar with DECENTRANDOM system to use its features.

Use Case

Lottery and Lucky Draws
DECENTRANDOM provides a fair, transparent, and irreversible process of selecting a winner. It is cost efficient as no middlemen are needed in the process.

Team / Class Pairing
DECENTRANDOM can be used to group participants fairly by eliminating subject bias.

Game Item Drop Propbablity
DECENTRANDOM can be used to control game item drop probability, dice, card shuffling and more.

Housing Purchase Rights Raffle
DECENTRANDOM can be used to select a group for housing purchase rights as well as allocating the participants randomly. Organizers of the raffle can ensure transparency and fairness

Improve Existing Systems
DECENTRANDOM can add transparency for the existing process of extracurricular activity selection, preschool entry selection, and more.

And Many More
Survey population selection, random box contents, plate number designation are some of the ways DECENTRANDOM can be used.

RAND TOKEN

About RAND Token

SYMBOL : RAND
Genesis Supply : 1,000,000,000 RAND

RAND tokens will not be sold via ICO (or any similar shape or form). 100% of the genesis supply will be given out to contributors of the project. Rather than receiving an investment to develop the project, DECENTRANDOM aims to allocate its token supply for those who contribute to its development, marketing, community building and more.
10% of the genesis supply (100,000,000 RAND) will be given out to early contributors of the project. (Completed as of May 2019. Please refer to this page for details)
60% of the genesis supply (600,000,000 RAND) will be given out to contributors from the testnet phase to the mainnet phase.
30% of the genesis supply (300,000,000 RAND) will be given out to contributors after the mainnet phase.
